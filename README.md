# Secret Contracts

This repository showcases example secret contracts such as secret voting, secret auctions, and secret TCRs. This repository is very much a work in progress and expect it to be updated almost daily.

# Design Features:

Voting: Locked token-weighting(similar to the PLCR model), support for multiple timed polls, custom quorum percentages.
Auction: Simple sealed bid auction.
TCRs: WIP

# Instructions:

Follow the instructions here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZGbbTukXyb6bRaw-GvEvVE7OWRfduuJgRfBXUpsHu8/edit?usp=sharing

# Important Notes:

* Several test scripts are outdated.
* I have taken parts from the 'enigma-contract' repository and included them in this repository such as the Enigma/Enigma Token contracts, the Enigma JS library files, and example test data.
